This article develops a distributed algorithm for developing an energy-efficient backbone for military ad hoc network composed of multiple layers, namely E2CLB. The algorithm is based on the concepts of connected dominating sets and also on node centrality concepts, and results as a heuristic solution to the problem of calculating a maximum energy, minimum connected dominating set for a multilayer network by including into the dominating set those nodes which are highly connected to their and other layers (i.e., they have large centrality value) and moreover they are energy-rich. The computation and communication complexities of the algorithm are analyzed, and a thorough simulation-based evaluation of it against six competitors is presented. The results show that E2CLB is either the best performing algorithm across the examined performance measures or it is able to trade a very small increase in the size of the backbone’s network in order to reap improved performance in the energy realm."  data-placement="right" >Abstract</a></li>

This problem, also referred to as \textitseed selection for influence maximization, has been under intensive investigation since the emergence of social networks. Nonetheless, a large body of existing research is based on the assumption that the network is completely known, whereas little work considers partially observable networks. Yet, due to many issues including the extremely large size of current networks and privacy considerations, assuming full knowledge of the network is rather unrealistic. Despite this, an influencer often wishes to distribute its message far beyond the boundaries of the known network. In this paper, we propose a set of novel heuristic algorithms that specifically target nodes at this boundary, in order to maximize influence across the whole network. We show that these algorithms outperform the state of the art by up to 38% in networks with partial observability."  data-placement="right" >Abstract</a></li>

Cognitive Appraisal Theory is used to evaluate incoming memes “pronounced” by external speakers, appraising the effects of the memes on an individual’s self-esteem taking account of their group relationships as indicated by social identity theory, and leading to an emotion in the individual. Appraisal is followed by a process of coping that seeks to handle the effects by either performing problem-focused (critical) or emotion-focused (uncritical) thinking, according to the current emotional state of the individual. This model is implemented within a Cognitive Architecture (Soar) as a set of reasoning processes that handle beliefs and emotion. The model is integrated into a multi-agent simulation tool (Repast Simphony) allowing the simulation of populations of individuals interacting and spreading rumours, or memes, together with interventions.

A microgrid fulfills local demand using local generation (conventional and renewable) and storage, along with the electric grid (macrogrid).

Optimal management of the resources in a microgrid is necessary to integrate the uncertain renewable energy, serve the uncertain demand and provide the highest returns in terms of cost or emissions. The approach developed in this paper requires minimal modeling effort with regards to uncertainties and emphasizes battery pricing using realized profiles of demand and PV generation. We show that the optimal decision at each time instant is an economic dispatch that takes a rigorously-defined shadow-price for the battery power as input. Furthermore, we show that the calculation of this shadow-price can be simplified to avoid state-constraints in the computation of the optimal control solution.

Furthermore, we show that the calculation of this shadow-price can be simplified to avoid state-constraints in the computation of the optimal control solution. Finally, the results highlight the practical utility of this approach and the developed quasi-optimal solution is comparable to the deterministic optimum cost."  data-placement="below" >Abstract</a></li>

Epidemic routing is well-suited for these environments due to its simplicity and fully distributed implementation. In epidemic routing, messages are relayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of nodes come within transmission range. Each node needs to decide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its residual energy level and the age of that message.

  We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and forwarding efficacy as a heterogeneous dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove, somewhat surprisingly given the complex nature of the problem, that in the mean field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy.

Epidemic processes encompass a variety of models of propagation that are based on contact between agents. Assumptions of homogeneity of communication rates, resources, and epidemics themselves in prior literature gloss over the heterogeneities inherent to such networks and lead to the design of sub-optimal control policies. However, the added complexity that comes with a more nuanced view of such networks complicates the generalizing of most prior work and necessitates the use of new analytical methods. We first create a taxonomy of heterogeneity in the spread of epidemics. We then model the evolution of heterogeneous epidemics in the realms of biology and sociology, as well as those arising from practice in the fields of communication networks (e.g., DTN message routing) and security (e.g., malware spread and patching). In each case, we obtain computational frameworks using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle that will lead to the derivation of dynamic controls that optimize general, context-specific objectives.  We then prove structures for each of these vectors of optimal controls that can simplify the derivation, storage, and implementation of optimal policies. Finally, using simulations and real-world traces, we examine the benefits achieved by including heterogeneity in the control decision, as well as the sensitivity of the models and the controls to model parameters in each case."  data-placement="right" >Abstract</a></li>
