  abstract={In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energy constrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In DTNs, connected paths between source and destination rarely materialize due to the mobility and sparse density of nodes. Epidemic routing is well-suited for these environments due to its simplicity and fully distributed implementation. In epidemic routing, messages are relayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of nodes come within transmission range. Each node needs to decide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its residual energy level and the age of that message.

  We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and forwarding efficacy as a heterogeneous dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove, somewhat surprisingly given the complex nature of the problem, that in the mean field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We analytically establish this result under generalized classes of utility functions for DTNs. We then characterize the dependence of these thresholds on current energy reserves in each node.},

  abstract={Studies on the propagation of malware in mobile networks have revealed that the spread of malware can be highly inhomogeneous. Platform diversity, contact list utilization by the malware, clustering in the network structure, etc., can also lead to differing spreading rates. In this paper, a general formal framework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal patching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of malware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for a stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field deterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold policies. These policies are amenable to implementation and can serve as benchmarks for policies that have less knowledge of the network. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching policies is investigated in sample topologies, and their advantages are demonstrated.},

  abstract={We obtain optimal strategies for the allocation of influence budget across multiple channels and across time for an external influencer, e.g., a political campaign, seeking to maximize its effect on an election given a network of agents with linear consensus-seeking opinion dynamics. We show that for a general set of objective functions, the optimal influence strategy at every time uses all channels at either their maximum rate or not at all. Furthermore, we prove that the number of switches between these extremes is bounded above both by a term that is typically much smaller than the number of agents. This means that the optimal influence strategy is to exert maximum effort in waves for every channel, and then cease effort and let the effects propagate. We also show that at the beginning, the total cost-adjusted reach of a channel determines its relative value, while targeting matters more closer to election time. We demonstrate that the optimal influence structures are easily computable in several practical cases. We explicitly characterize the optimal controls for the case of linear objective functions via a closed form. Finally, we see that in the canonical election example, identifying late-deciders approximately determines the optimal campaign resource allocation strategy.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of choosing influential members within a social network, in order to disseminate a message as widely as possible. While this so-called problem of {influence maximisation} has been widely studied, little work considers partially-observable networks, where only part of a network is visible to the decision maker. Yet, this is critical in many applications, where an organisation needs to distribute its message far beyond its boundaries and beyond its usual sphere of influence. In this paper, we show that existing algorithms are not sufficient to handle such scenarios. To address this, we propose a set of novel adaptive algorithms that perform well in partially observable settings, achieving an up to 18\% improvement on the non-adaptive state of the art.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of selecting the most influential members within a social network, in order to disseminate a message as widely as possible. This problem, also referred to as \textit{seed selection} for influence maximization, has been under intensive investigation since the emergence of social networks. Nonetheless, a large body of existing research is based on the assumption that the network is completely known, whereas little work considers partially observable networks. Yet, due to many issues including the extremely large size of current networks and privacy considerations, assuming full knowledge of the network is rather unrealistic. Despite this, an influencer often wishes to distribute its message far beyond the boundaries of the known network. In this paper, we propose a set of novel heuristic algorithms that specifically target nodes at this boundary, in order to maximize influence across the whole network. We show that these algorithms outperform the state of the art by up to 38\% in networks with partial observability.},

  abstract={In this paper, we seek to identity how mathematical and economic analysis can be used to gain insights about the mutation of social groups. Group mutability has been studied in multiple domains, with insights generated on significant factors at differing scales. Mathematical modeling enables the simultaneous study of such phenomena, understanding interactions and generating hypotheses for experiments.
  In particular, we focus on group fracture, where individuals leave groups of which they are members. For example, this can be due to perceived differences with other group members due to norm related conflict (such as extreme actions by some members). Our aim is to consider simple mathematical models incorporating a selection of social and psychological theory which  describes these phenomena as a way to understand their {interplay}, and describe the trade-offs and challenges. This will help a federation model the behavior of extremist groups, and determine not only when an intervention is necessary, but also the best course of action to take to induce the fracture of such groups.  This paper is an exploratory investigation into methods of achieving this goal and evaluating the usefulness of the outputs to federations.},

  abstract={Recent innovations in the design of computer viruses have led to new trade-offs for the attacker. Multiple variants of a malware may spread at different rates and have different levels of visibility to the network. In this work we examine the optimal strategies for the attacker so as to trade off the extent of spread of the malware against the need for stealth. We show that in the mean-field deterministic regime, this spread-stealth trade-off is optimized by computationally simple single-threshold policies. Specifically, we show that only one variant of the malware is spread by the attacker at each time, as there exists a time up to which the attacker prioritizes maximizing the spread of the malware, and after which she prioritizes stealth.},

  year={2015},
  organization={IEEE},
  abstract={This paper develops an optimal dispatch strategy for a microgrid's resources through battery pricing. A microgrid fulfills local demand using local generation (conventional and renewable) and storage, along with the electric grid (macrogrid). Demand and renewables such as Photovoltaic (PV) generation are uncertain throughout the day. Optimal management of the resources in a microgrid is necessary to integrate the uncertain renewable energy, serve the uncertain demand and provide the highest returns in terms of cost or emissions. The approach developed in this paper requires minimal modeling effort with regards to uncertainties and emphasizes battery pricing using realized profiles of demand and PV generation. We show that the optimal decision at each time instant is an economic dispatch that takes a rigorously-defined shadow-price for the battery power as input. Furthermore, we show that the calculation of this shadow-price can be simplified to avoid state-constraints in the computation of the optimal control solution. Finally, the results highlight the practical utility of this approach and the developed quasi-optimal solution is comparable to the deterministic optimum cost.},

  title={Optimal control of epidemics in the presence of heterogeneity},
  author={ESHGHI, Soheil},
  school={University of Pennsylvania},
  year={2015},
  abstract={We seek to identify and address how different types of heterogeneity affect the optimal control of epidemic processes in social, biological, and computer networks. Epidemic processes encompass a variety of models of propagation that are based on contact between agents. Assumptions of homogeneity of communication rates, resources, and epidemics themselves in prior literature gloss over the heterogeneities inherent to such networks and lead to the design of sub-optimal control policies. However, the added complexity that comes with a more nuanced view of such networks complicates the generalizing of most prior work and necessitates the use of new analytical methods. We first create a taxonomy of heterogeneity in the spread of epidemics. We then model the evolution of heterogeneous epidemics in the realms of biology and sociology, as well as those arising from practice in the fields of communication networks (e.g., DTN message routing) and security (e.g., malware spread and patching). In each case, we obtain computational frameworks using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle that will lead to the derivation of dynamic controls that optimize general, context-specific objectives.  We then prove structures for each of these vectors of optimal controls that can simplify the derivation, storage, and implementation of optimal policies. Finally, using simulations and real-world traces, we examine the benefits achieved by including heterogeneity in the control decision, as well as the sensitivity of the models and the controls to model parameters in each case.},
