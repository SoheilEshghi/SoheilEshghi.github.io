  author={Papakostas, D and ESHGHI, S and Katsaros, D and Tassiulas, L},
  journal={Ad Hoc Networks},
  publisher={Springer},
  status={accepted},
  abstract={Ad hoc networks designed for deployment in modern battlefields need to take care of traditional requirements related to their backbone's size, their energy efficiency, their scalability in terms of network size, but also of their nature which allows for combining networks of different units that act altogether towards a common operational goal. This article develops a distributed algorithm for developing an energy-efficient backbone for military ad hoc network composed of multiple layers, namely E2CLB. The algorithm is based on the concepts of connected dominating sets and also on node centrality concepts, and results as a heuristic solution to the problem of calculating a maximum energy, minimum connected dominating set for a multilayer network by including into the dominating set those nodes which are highly connected to their and other layers (i.e., they have large centrality value) and moreover they are energy-rich. The computation and communication complexities of the algorithm are analyzed, and a thorough simulation-based evaluation of it against six competitors is presented. The results show that E2CLB is either the best performing algorithm across the examined performance measures or it is able to trade a very small increase in the size of the backbone's network in order to reap improved performance in the energy realm.},

  abstract={We analyze optimal strategies for the allocation of a finite budget that can be invested in different advertising channels over time with the objective of influencing social opinions in a network of individuals. In our analysis, we consider both exogenous influence mechanisms, such as advertising campaigns, as well as endogenous mechanisms of social influence, such as word-of-mouth and peerpressure, which are modeled using diffusion dynamics. We show that for a general set of objective functions, the optimal influence strategy at every time uses all channels at either their maximum rate or not at all, i.e., a bang-bang strategy. Furthermore, we prove that the number of switches between these extremes is bounded above by a term that is typically much smaller than the number of agents. This means that the optimal influence strategy is to exert maximum effort in waves for every channel, and then cease effort and let the effects propagate. We also show that, at the beginning of the campaign, the total cost-adjusted reach of an exogenous advertising channel determines its relative value. In contrast, as we approach our investment horizon (e.g., election day), the optimal strategy is to invest in channels able to target individuals instead of broad-reaching channels. We demonstrate that the optimal influence strategies are easily computable in several practical cases, and explicitly characterize the optimal controls for the case of linear objective functions in closed form. Finally, we see that, in the canonical example of designing an election campaign, identifying late-deciders is a critical component in the optimal design.},

  abstract={Studies on the propagation of malware in mobile networks have revealed that the spread of malware can be highly inhomogeneous. Platform diversity, contact list utilization by the malware, clustering in the network structure, etc., can also lead to differing spreading rates. In this paper, a general formal framework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal patching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of malware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for a stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field deterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold policies. These policies are amenable to implementation and can serve as benchmarks for policies that have less knowledge of the network. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching policies is investigated in sample topologies, and their advantages are demonstrated.},

Multiple variants of a malware may spread at different rates and have different levels of visibility to the network. In this work we examine the optimal strategies for the attacker so as to trade off the extent of spread of the malware against the need for stealth. We show that in the mean-field deterministic regime, this spread-stealth trade-off is optimized by computationally simple single-threshold policies. Specifically, we show that only one variant of the malware is spread by the attacker at each time, as there exists a time up to which the attacker prioritizes maximizing the spread of the malware, and after which she prioritizes stealth.},

We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and a measure of Quality of Service as a dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove that in the mean-field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We then characterize the nature of this dependence. Our simulations reveal that the optimal dynamic policy significantly outperforms heuristics.},

  status={in preparation},
  abstract={Monitoring and maintaining communications in a multilayer ad hoc wireless network requires a stable communication overlay. Such monitoring should be resilient, avoiding reliance on a single (or a few) layers, and energy-aware, not being vulnerable to the exhaustion of available energy in a single network element. Thus, there is possibly a trade-off between overlay size, interlayer connectivity and the energy distribution within the overlay. In this paper, we present three distributed energy-aware multilayer connected edge dominating set algorithms, show how they manage such trade-offs in practical scenarios, and show that CCEDS, a pruned centrality-based distributed algorithm, has the best performance.},

  abstract={We model the effect of networks on the uptake of risky innovations by workers and the policy-making of their employers as a Stackelberg game. We individuals can report specific instances of observed risky behavior to management, in contrast with anonymous cases where only the existence of such behavior is reported without mention of potential culprits. We contrast the subgame-perfect equilibria of the semi-anonymous model for general networks and for regular graphs with the corresponding anonymous whistleblowing case, in which whistleblowing has been shown to only flourish in a light-punishment regime. We observe that semi-anonymous whistleblowing can lead to better equilibrium outcomes for the manager, as the network structure induces differences in policies chosen by the workers which can be exploited by the manager to maintain moderate amounts of risky innovation. Workers will choose degreedependent threshold policies that instruct them to cheat if the audit probability is below the threshold and to report observed cheating otherwise. Without this network-induced heterogeneity (e.g., for regular graphs), the outcome of semi-anonymous whistleblowing resembles that of anonymous policies. Finally, we show that in a light-punishment regime, workers with the fewest neighbors will be the likeliest to cheat.},

Agent-based modelling of this behaviour, using evolutionary approaches, further provides a powerful tool to examine the implications of these theories in a dynamic context. In particular, this can enhance our understanding of the escalation of hostility and warfare, and its mitigation, contributing to policy and interventions. In this paper we propose a framework through which social psychology can be embedded in computation for the examination of inter-group behaviour. We examine how various social-psychological theories can be embedded in evolutionary models, and identify ways in which visualisation can support the objective assessment of emergent behaviour. We also discuss how real-world data can be used to parameterise scenarios on which modelling is conducted.},

  abstract={We consider the problem of choosing influential members within a social network, in order to disseminate a message as widely as possible. While this so-called problem of {influence maximisation} has been widely studied, little work considers partially-observable networks, where only part of a network is visible to the decision maker. Yet, this is critical in many applications, where an organisation needs to distribute its message far beyond its boundaries and beyond its usual sphere of influence. In this paper, we show that existing algorithms are not sufficient to handle such scenarios. To address this, we propose a set of novel adaptive algorithms that perform well in partially observable settings, achieving an up to 18\% improvement on the non-adaptive state of the art.},

  title={A framework for modelling the effect of emotion on uncritical reasoning},
  author={Mott, D and Kelley, T  and Giammanco, C and ESHGHI, S and Zhang, Y},
  abstract={We describe research on understanding group mutability in the behaviour of external groups, and how interventions by coalition forces may affect the behaviour in terms of controlling hostile groups and encouraging friendly groups. We explore how emotion may influence the behaviour of individuals by affecting the type of reasoning that they undertake, encouraging ``uncritical'' rather than ``critical'' thinking. We describe a computational framework holding a cognitive model of an individual operating within a group context, inspired by theories from social science. Individuals relate to in-groups and out-groups and have beliefs that are associated with emotions. Cognitive Appraisal Theory is used to evaluate incoming memes ``pronounced'' by external speakers, appraising the effects of the memes on an individual's self-esteem taking account of their group relationships as indicated by social identity theory, and leading to an emotion in the individual. Appraisal is followed by a process of coping that seeks to handle the effects by either performing problem-focused (critical) or emotion-focused (uncritical) thinking, according to the current emotional state of the individual. This model is implemented within a Cognitive Architecture (Soar) as a set of reasoning processes that handle beliefs and emotion. The model is integrated into a multi-agent simulation tool (Repast Simphony) allowing the simulation of populations of individuals interacting and spreading rumours, or memes, together with interventions. We describe how this framework could be used to construct experiments to explore how different situations lead to group mutability and behaviour, together with the effects of interventions by coalition forces.},

  abstract={This paper develops an optimal dispatch strategy for a microgrid's resources through battery pricing. A microgrid fulfills local demand using local generation (conventional and renewable) and storage, along with the electric grid (macrogrid). Demand and renewables such as Photovoltaic (PV) generation are uncertain throughout the day. Optimal management of the resources in a microgrid is necessary to integrate the uncertain renewable energy, serve the uncertain demand and provide the highest returns in terms of cost or emissions. The approach developed in this paper requires minimal modeling effort with regards to uncertainties and emphasizes battery pricing using realized profiles of demand and PV generation. We show that the optimal decision at each time instant is an economic dispatch that takes a rigorously-defined shadow-price for the battery power as input. Furthermore, we show that the calculation of this shadow-price can be simplified to avoid state-constraints in the computation of the optimal control solution. Finally, the results highlight the practical utility of this approach and the developed quasi-optimal solution is comparable to the deterministic optimum cost.},

  abstract={In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energy constrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In DTNs, connected paths between source and destination rarely materialize due to the mobility and sparse density of nodes. Epidemic routing is well-suited for these environments due to its simplicity and fully distributed implementation. In epidemic routing, messages are relayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of nodes come within transmission range. Each node needs to decide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its residual energy level and the age of that message.

  We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and forwarding efficacy as a heterogeneous dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove, somewhat surprisingly given the complex nature of the problem, that in the mean field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We analytically establish this result under generalized classes of utility functions for DTNs. We then characterize the dependence of these thresholds on current energy reserves in each node.},

  title={Optimal control of epidemics in the presence of heterogeneity},
  author={ESHGHI, S},
  school={University of Pennsylvania},
  year={2015},
  abstract={We seek to identify and address how different types of heterogeneity affect the optimal control of epidemic processes in social, biological, and computer networks. Epidemic processes encompass a variety of models of propagation that are based on contact between agents. Assumptions of homogeneity of communication rates, resources, and epidemics themselves in prior literature gloss over the heterogeneities inherent to such networks and lead to the design of sub-optimal control policies. However, the added complexity that comes with a more nuanced view of such networks complicates the generalizing of most prior work and necessitates the use of new analytical methods. We first create a taxonomy of heterogeneity in the spread of epidemics. We then model the evolution of heterogeneous epidemics in the realms of biology and sociology, as well as those arising from practice in the fields of communication networks (e.g., DTN message routing) and security (e.g., malware spread and patching). In each case, we obtain computational frameworks using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle that will lead to the derivation of dynamic controls that optimize general, context-specific objectives.  We then prove structures for each of these vectors of optimal controls that can simplify the derivation, storage, and implementation of optimal policies. Finally, using simulations and real-world traces, we examine the benefits achieved by including heterogeneity in the control decision, as well as the sensitivity of the models and the controls to model parameters in each case.},
