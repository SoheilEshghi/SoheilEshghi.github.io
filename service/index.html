    <p>The School District of Philadelphia (a city I care for deeply) <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/">was in a no-win situation</a>: No textbooks and educational materials, leading to poor student outcomes, leading to funding cuts.
    As part of a pro-bono student project at the University of Pennsylvania, I helped develop
    a solution for managing inventory (e.g., textbooks, musical instruments, and computing
    equipment) for large, low-income school districts such as the School District of
    Philadelphia. We won the Penn Public Policy Challenge ’15, and placed second in the National Public
    Policy Challenge ’15. We interviewed and received support from local, state, and national politicians and educators to understand needs and finetune our product. Our work has been featured in numerous publications, including Governing magazine. My team was one of 9 out of 300 teams accepted to EDSi accelerator at Penn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-many-phds-actually-get-to-become-college-professors/273434/">Only 1 out of every 5 PhD graduates becomes a professor</a>. Management consulting is one of the best options for PhDs considering leaving academia, as (in my experience) it is fun, dynamic, and impactful. At Cornell, I created and curated an ongoing progression of 7 events to increase interest and improve consulting interview success in the membership. I also put together and MC’ed a panel of Advanced Degree consultants who shared their experiences. I also led a team of 6 pro-bono consultants over 3 months to devise a marketing plan for a local mobile tourism startup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.penngradconsulting.com/">Pro-bono consulting is an ingrained part of the PhD experience at Penn.</a> Over the course of 6 months, I organized the logistics, client selection, case creation, and sponsorship with my team
and MC’ed the annual case competition event. We out-raised our max cost projections by 110% and increased diversity of internal and
external participants (with 9 sponsors and 5 schools represented). Furthermore, the winning proposal was implemented by the case client within 3 months.</p>
