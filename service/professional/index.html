          At Penn, our team of 4 developed, designed, and rolled out
          a solution for managing inventory (e.g., textbooks, musical instruments, and computing
          equipment) for large, low-income school districts such as the School District of
          Philadelphia.<br><br> We won the Penn Public Policy Challenge ’15, and placed second in the National Public
          Policy Challenge ’15. Our work has been featured in numerous publications, including Governing magazine. Our team was one of 9 out of 300 teams accepted to EDSi accelerator at Penn.</p>

Management consulting is one of the best options for PhDs considering leaving academia, as (in my experience) it is fun, dynamic, and impactful.<br><br> At Cornell, I created and curated an ongoing progression of 7 events to increase interest and improve consulting interview success in the membership. I also put together and MC’ed a panel of Advanced Degree consultants who shared their experiences.<br><br> Finally, I led a team of 6 pro-bono consultants over 3 months to devise a marketing plan for a local mobile tourism startup.</p>

      and MC’ed the  event. <br><br> We out-raised our maximum cost projections by 110% and increased diversity of internal and
      external participants (with 9 sponsors and 5 schools represented). Furthermore, the winning proposal was implemented by the case client within 3 months.</p>
