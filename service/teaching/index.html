  <p style="text-align:justify; width:90%">I completed a 3-month long <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/ctl/programs_services/graduate_student_programs/mini-courses_in_college_teaching">Course in College Teaching</a> while I was at Penn. I also completed a 3-month long program of workshops in <a href="http://gradschool.cornell.edu/cu-cirtl/mentoring-program"></a>building mentoring skills for an academic career</a> while at Cornell.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;  width:90%">As a teacher, I believe in eliciting frequent feedback, building in opportunities for engagement, and adjusting the curriculum to the class. I enjoy spending time to <a href="/service/professional/">help others achieve their academic and professional goals</a>, just as countless others have helped me achieve mine.</p>
