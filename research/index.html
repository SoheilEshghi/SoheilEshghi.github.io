       <h2>Control of Dynamic Influence:</h2>
       <p style="font-size: 0.9em;text-align:justify;"> What shapes the outcomes of a networked society? The influence of a person or channel is typically measured using static measures (such as centrality). Even the majority of work that considers the dynamics of a society in finding influential nodes only considers static allocations (e.g., seeding).<br> I study how dynamic influence can be compared across people and time, and how theories from the social sciences and micro-economics can be integrated into models of dynamic influence.

   <h2>Grid-Scale Batteries and Electric Vehicles:</h2>
   <p style="font-size: 0.9em;text-align:justify;"> The integration of renewables in the electrical grid at significant scale requires a simultaneous increase in the integration of batteries and electric vehicles to mitigate uncertainty in generation.<br> I study how batteries and electric vehicles should be charged & discharged to meet goals and minimize operation costs, making the economic case for storage.

       <h2>Dynamic Control of Epidemics and Epidemic Processes:</h2>
       <p style="font-size: 0.9em; text-align:justify;"> Epidemics are one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. However, we now have more data than ever before that we can leverage in designing dynamic interventions. Furthermore, epidemic models neatly capture problems in cyber-security and data transfer.<br> I draw upon the literature in mathematical epidemiology to model both types of epidemics, and design optimal containment and spreading policies using optimal control theory.
