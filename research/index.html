        <h3> 1: <b>Dynamic, efficient, and practical control policies for epidemics </b> </h3>
        <p>
          My work has focused on proving parameter-independent structures for the containment
          of dynamic spreading processes using optimal control theory, and applying them to real-world problems in public health
          and analogous problems in wireless networks
          and network security.
          <br><br>

          These structures are important because the availability of fine-grained data,
          as well as the ability to change actions over time, can lead to state-space explosion
          for policy design as well as unrealistically complex proposed policies.
         I show how these structures can simplify difficult non-convex
         optimizations and provide easily implementible distributed policies.
         <br><br>
         I have applied this approach to
         evaluate a real-world intervention vs a dynamic counterfactual optimal policy, which is a methodological contribution.


        <h3> 2: <b>Optimizing constrained and dynamic networked interventions</b> </h3>
        <p>
          My work has focused on showing how limited information availability and
          dynamic policies can change approaches to seeding networked interventions
          (i.e., social influence and incentives that lead to changes in  behavior, choices, and beliefs).<br><br>

          I have
          addressed key applications in public health, marketing, and sociology in multiple
          inter-disciplinary collaborations using techniques from optimal control and game theory:

            <li> <p>optimal seeding strategies under partial network visibility</p></li>
            <li><p>optimal budget allocation across time for an electoral campaign (including the
            development of a new centrality measure)</p></li>
            <li><p>the effect of incentives and whistleblowing policies on ethical behavior within an organization</p></li>
           <li><p>the effect of social comparison and group norms on social group stability</p></li>
           </ol>



        <h3> Prior areas:</h3>
        <p> <b>Energy-aware information dissemination and monitoring in ad hoc networks:</b>  My main contribution has been to create efficient, distributed, and energy-aware algorithms to
          create and maintain connectivity in wireless ad hoc networks<br><br>

          <b>Grid-scale integration of distributed storage:</b>  My main contribution has been to create a novel method for the efficient operation of
          microgrids with distributed renewable generation and storage using rigorously derived dynamic prices for microgrid batteries, and creating a synthesis of
          offline electric vehicle charging methods and identifying major remaining challenges
