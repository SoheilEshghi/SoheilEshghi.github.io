  <p>Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania's Electrical and Systems Engineering Department. I am honoured to have been supervised by Professor Saswati Sarkar and Professor Santosh S. Venkatesh.</p>
  
  <p>My PhD thesis was on the optimal control of epidemics in the presence of heterogeneity. I looked at how a more granular view of the spread of an epidemic can help us to design better policies.</p>
