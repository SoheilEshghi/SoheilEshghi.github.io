<div class = "blurb">
  <p>I am a postdoctoral associate at <a href="yins.yale.edu">Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS)</a> and Yale's <a href="http://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering">Department of Electrical Engineering</a>, and I am honored to be supervised by <a href="http://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/leandros-tassiulas">Professor Leandros Tassiulas</a>.</p>

  <p>
    I use optimal control, dynamical systems, and game theory to study social, biological, and engineered networks. In particular, I am interested in understanding influence in human (and more generally, biological) networks. I am delighted to have had (and have!) the opportunity to work with social scientists, economists, biologists, and engineers.

  <p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at Cornell, where I worked on networks of teams and their effect on the spread of opinions and influence (with Professor Qing Zhao), as well as various topics on the charging of electric vehicles (with Professor Lang Tong).</p>

  <p>Prior to that, I was a PhD Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania's Electrical and Systems Engineering Department. I am honoured to have been supervised by <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~swati/"> Professor Saswati Sarkar</a> and <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~venkates/">Professor Santosh S. Venkatesh</a>.</p>

  <p>My PhD thesis was on the optimal control of epidemics in the presence of heterogeneity. I looked at how a more granular view of the spread of an epidemic can help us to design better policies.</p>
