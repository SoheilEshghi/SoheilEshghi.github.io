                <p style="text-align:justify;">I completed a <a style="inline" href="http://www.upenn.edu/ctl/programs_services/graduate_student_programs/mini-courses_in_college_teaching">course in college teaching</a> at Penn, a course on <a style="inline" href="http://gradschool.cornell.edu/cu-cirtl/mentoring-program"> mentoring skills for academics</a> at Cornell, and a course on <a style="inline" href="5 http://ctl.yale.edu/event/expressing-your-enthusiasm-oral-communication-workshop-stem-graduate-students-and-postdocs">effective oral communication</a> at Yale.<br><br>

                  As a teacher, I believe in frequent feedback, building in opportunities for engagement, and adjusting the curriculum to the class. I enjoy <a href="/professional/">helping others achieve their academic and professional goals</a>, just as countless others have helped me achieve mine.</p>
