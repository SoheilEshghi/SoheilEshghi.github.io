My academic website.

I have used the github pages and local generation method of creating my static website.

If you need Jekyll Scholar formatting tips, look at my bibtemplate layout.

No claim is made to the underlying software, bootstrap, Jekyll, Jekyll Scholar, etc., all of which are used under The MIT license.
